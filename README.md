# Lab1_computational_skills

# Introduction

Over the course of this class you will sharpen your computational skills. You may come into this course with extensive bioinformatics experience or you may just be starting out. I will be providing you with most of the commands you will need to execute. You will, however, need to design and execute some analyses yourself. 

For this week's lab we will focus on making sure everyone has the skills needed to access the UNC Charlotte research cluster.
